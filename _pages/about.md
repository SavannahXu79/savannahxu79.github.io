Hi :wave:, this is Yue Xu (Savannah).
I’m a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at ShanghaiTech University, advised by Prof. [Wenjie Wang](https://wwj95.github.io/). My research explores **AI alignment**, including safety, fairness, and robustness on large language and multimodal models, aiming to build intelligent systems that are both trustworthy and adaptive.

Recently, I’ve been focusing on the **personalization** of large language models (LLMs) and LLM-powered agents, exploring how memory, preference modeling, and adaptive reasoning can enable human-aligned, self-evolving agents.
